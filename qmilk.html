  <div class="info">Anke Domaske, a micro-biologist and designer who lives in Hannover, Germany, discovered a creative way of producing textiles. In 2011, she invented Qmilch, a silky fabric woven from casein, a protein present in milk.<br><br>
    Basically, QMilk is a textile produced from milk that is no longer fit for consumption as food or tradable. It is a patented, specially-designed spinning process that elaborates natural fibres with the smallest footprint. Moreover, it is manufactured with 100% renewable resources and is a totally natural product. For example, only an hour and 2 litres of water are required to create 1 kg of QMilk fabric. Low resources and energy are needed for the production, with a result of almost zero waste, and CO2 emissions are minimal. In addition to all of this, everything is produced locally and the textile is absolutely biodegradable in compost after a few weeks.</div>
