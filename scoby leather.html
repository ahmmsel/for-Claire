  <div class="kombuchaclothinginfo">Fashion student, Molly Ryan, has always designed with the planet in mind. During the Curtin University runway in Perth, I wasn’t the only person to do a double-take when it was announced that Molly’s entire collection, Fragments, was completely waste-free.<br><br>
  According to Molly, using SCOBY to achieve this waste-free mission was a no brainer. Though fabricating the material wasn’t as simple as using conventional fabrics. It involved a lot of trial and error.

  <div class="info">“This (the lack of widespread SCOBY leather knowledge) lent itself to difficulties, but also successes,” says Molly. “I felt it was a totally organic learning and design process.” “After becoming inspired by Susan Lee’s (a pioneer in the field of bio cloth for clothing) project, I became fixated on growing the SCOBY ‘into’ fabric, especially damaged fabric, as a means of repair,”<br><br>
  “Which led me to my final concept of Bio Boro; the application of a SCOBY to fabric to mend, build and repair. Drawing inspiration from the traditional Japanese technique, BoroBoro, to be mended or patched together.”</div>
